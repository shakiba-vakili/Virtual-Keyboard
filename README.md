# Virtual Keyboard
The [virtual keyboard](https://shakiba-vakili.github.io/Virtual-Keyboard/) project was an interesting experience. In this project, in addition to learning the structure of the keyboard, I learned how to code dark and light modes. Also, in this project, there is a colour palette in that you can change the appearance of the keyboard by choosing the desired colour.
